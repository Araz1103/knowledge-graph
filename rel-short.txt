
The Theory of General Relativity demonstrates that Black Holes are hidden by an Event Horizon.
Soon after publishing the special theory of relativity in 1905, 
Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic 
framework. There is nothing here. In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer 
in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a 
relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, 
his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 
of what are now known as the Einstein field equations, which form the core of 
Einstein's famous Theory of General Relativity. These equations specify how the 
geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present.
